DESCRIPTION: An app that tracks driving. It uses GPS data to "rate" your driving, to see how quickly
you accelerate, brake, whether or not you're following the speed limit, etc. It could be used for 
people to try and improve their driving habits, or for parents to track new drivers to see how well
they are doing.
