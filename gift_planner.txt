DESCRIPTION: A piece of software that uses the Facebook API (and maybe other social media?) to show friends
with upcoming birthdays and their interests/liked pages. Use that information to generate ideas for gifts
and search Amazon and other online stores for products. Allow people to manually add interests, filter results
by price/sales, etc. There are probably other features that would be useful that we would discover along the way.
