DESCRIPTION: We could make a web application that can make/permute possible
course schedules based on inputs of what classes the user is taking. I was
thinking of using a webcrawler to search through classes, then use that 
data to figure out possible schedules, figure out time conflicts, and 
maybe we could even add some support for graph theory stuff to optimize
schedules for finding classes that are close one another, etc. There's def-
initely a lot of room for adding features here. Landen also mentioned
another application that is used for organizing work, and this project
could simply become a feature.
