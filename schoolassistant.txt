  This project will create software that will have features such as a parking garage manager, 
schedule builder, and meal selector (similar to urban spoon with on-campus dining). We could 
work with raspberry pi's for the parking garage sensors and demonstrate our project's functionality. 
This could be expanded with a number of different features that can assist students on campus 
in a number of ways.
